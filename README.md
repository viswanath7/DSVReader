# BETest

## Why?

We are interested in your skills as a developer. As part of our assessment, we want to see your code.

## Instructions

In this repo, you'll find two files, Workbook2.csv and Workbook2.prn. These files need to be converted to a HTML format by the code you deliver. Please consider your work as a proof of concept for a system that can keep track of credit limits from several sources.

This repository is created specially for you, so you can push anything you like. Please update this README to provide instructions, notes and/or comments for us.

## The Constraints

Please complete the test within 5 business days. Use any language / libs / tools you like.

## Remarks

**PRN format**: Requirements for the PRN file format is unclear to me. As far as my understanding goes, from searching for this format online, it's a text file created by the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet software.
It's tab delimited according to IBM 
[It's tab delimited according to IBM](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSPN2D_10.2.1/com.ibm.swg.im.cognos.cp_a.10.2.1.doc/cp_a_id71792DefineColumnsinanASCIIFile.html "It's tab delimited according to IBM").

Please also look at the [information from Microsoft on PRN file.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/excel/prn-file-limited-to-240-characters
 "information from Microsoft on PRN file.")

As the provided file wasn't tab delimited with UTF-8 encoding, I have chosen to fix it into a tab delimited file with UTF-8 encoding.

If you have any questions please send an email to DL-eCG-NL-assessment@ebay.com.
